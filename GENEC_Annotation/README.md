## GENEC Dataset Construction
The GENEC dataset is constructed semi-automatically. We extracted gene pairs and context sentences from PubMed+BioGRID, followed by human expert annotation. Two genomic research experts were tasked with annotating the gene pair causality. In cases of conflicting annotations, they discussed to reach a consensus. For more details, see our annotation guideline and the annotation trial documents.
